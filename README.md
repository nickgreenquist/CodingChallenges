# CodingChallenges

Inside this repo lives all the code I've written for a wide variety of problems aimed to help me prepare for technical interviews. The folder names indicate where the problems came from, and all my own code for each problem can be found inside. 

`Algorithms` and `DataStructures` simply contain code I've written for more advanced (yet very common) algorithms and data structures needed for techincal interviews.
